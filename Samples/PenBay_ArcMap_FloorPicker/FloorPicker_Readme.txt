Readme file for PenBay Floor Picker sample ArcMap addin.
July 12, 2014

Installation Instructions:

•	Double-click the add-in file.  It should install automatically.
•	In ArcMap, turn on the InVision Foundation Toolbar.
•	On the toolbar, push the button that looks like a gear to configure the layers in your map.  You can specify which field is used as a floor key.
•	If you’re going to save your MXD, use the reset button, which looks like an “X,” before you save.  The floor picker adds definition queries to the layers, while preserving any queries that where there when you opened the map.  If you save the MXD with a floor active, you’ll enshrine that floor in the MXD, and you won’t be able to see other floors the next time you open the MXD.  The reset button puts the definition queries back the way they were when you opened the MXD.
