FISDM (Facilities Information Spatial Data Model) is an open source project staffed by volunteers.  Any content found on this site is available for free.

The purpose of FISDM is to:
  - Develop a practical, replicable pattern for managing building and floor plan data in GIS
  - Help project teams get started in Facilities GIS
  - Support multiple applications / solutions (FISDM is not a solution)
  - Collaborate and share between groups working on different application problems
  - Be a step towards defining Facilities Solutions Templates
